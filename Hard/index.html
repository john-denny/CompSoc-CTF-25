                        <div class="poem text-center">
                            <p>Oh, gather 'round and hear the tale,<br>
                                Of Cathal, stout and true,<br>
                                The auditor of CompSoc's halls,<br>
                                A name both old and new.</p>

                            <p>With ledger firm and keen of eye,<br>
                                He kept the records clear,<br>
                                No errant coin, no misplaced dime,<br>
                                Escaped his watchful ear.</p>

                            <p>In meetings lit by flickering screens,<br>
                                He sat, both calm and wise,<br>
                                Deciphering the spreadsheets' truths,<br>
                                While others theorized.</p>

                            <p>"Secure the budget!" he would call,<br>
                                "Ensure the funds align!<br>
                                For every pizza, LAN, or prize,<br>
                                The numbers must combine."</p>

                            <p>But Cathal was no mere clerk, you see,<br>
                                He joined the games and fun,<br>
                                A master of the CTFs,<br>
                                A hacker's chosen one.</p>

                            <p>He cracked the code, he solved the clue,<br>
                                He led the daring raids,<br>
                                While balancing the books with care,<br>
                                In spreadsheets he had made.</p>

                            <p>The lore of Cathal soon did spread,<br>
                                Through every campus hall,<br>
                                A hero with a keyboard's might,<br>
                                And balance sheets for all.</p>

                            <p>So raise a glass to Cathal's name,<br>
                                The king of budget lore,<br>
                                The auditor of CompSoc's reign,<br>
                                A legend evermore.</p>
                        </div>
